Sowmya: Hey Nathan, hey Arya! Can you both hear me?
Nathan: Yes, loud and clear! How’s it going?
Arya: Yep, all good! What’s up, Sowmya?
Sowmya: So, I wanted to check in with you both about scheduling a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the new Creating Agents POC. I think we need to align on the scope before we move forward.
Nathan: That makes sense. Wednesday works for me. Do you have a time in mind?
Arya: I should be good on Wednesday too, as long as it's not too late in the day.
Sowmya: I was thinking around 11 AM. That way, we have enough time to go over the key points and set action items.
Nathan: 11 AM sounds reasonable. Will we be covering architecture, use cases, or more of the implementation plan?
Arya: Yeah, that’s a good point. Do we need to prepare anything beforehand, or is it more of a brainstorming session?
Sowmya: A bit of both. I’d like us to go over some potential architectures, but we also need to define the scope clearly. Right now, we have some high-level ideas, but I want to make sure we’re all aligned before we start building anything.
Nathan: Got it. Should we bring some reference materials or examples of existing agent frameworks?
Arya: I think that’d be helpful. Maybe we can look at how existing agent models handle memory, decision-making, and external integrations.
Sowmya: Exactly! If you both can gather some insights on the latest approaches, that’ll help us refine our direction.
Nathan: Sounds good. I’ll pull some examples from OpenAI’s recent work on agentic models and compare it with LangChain’s approaches.
Arya: I’ll check out what’s happening with multi-agent collaboration frameworks too. That could be useful for our POC.
Sowmya: Perfect! I’ll send out a calendar invite for Wednesday at 11 AM. We’ll meet on Zoom, and I’ll also draft a quick agenda so we stay on track.
Nathan: Cool, looking forward to it.
Arya: Same here! Thanks for setting this up, Sowmya.
Sowmya: No problem! See you both on Wednesday.
Nathan & Arya: See you then!
